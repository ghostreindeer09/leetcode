# Leetcode C++ Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems, all written in **C++**.

The purpose of this repo is to track progress, improve problem-solving skills, and serve as a reference for future revision or interview prep.

---

## üóÇ Structure

All solutions are placed in the **root** directory of the repository. Each file is named after the problem it solves, typically in the format:

```
<ProblemName>.cpp
```

Examples:

* `two_sum.cpp`
* `longest_substring_without_repeating_characters.cpp`
* `median_of_two_sorted_arrays.cpp`

Feel free to explore the code for each problem directly.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run a Solution

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ghostreindeer09/leetcode.git
   cd leetcode
   ```

2. **Compile and run any `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):**

   ```bash
   g++ two_sum.cpp -o two_sum
   ./two_sum
   ```

   Make sure you have a C++17+ compatible compiler installed (like `g++` or `clang++`).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some files may contain just the core logic (e.g., class/function definitions) without a `main()` function. These are intended for use within the Leetcode online judge and may need a `main()` wrapper to run locally.

## üìå Goals

* Practice daily Leetcode problems
* Improve algorithmic thinking and C++ skills
* Build a searchable archive of solved problems
